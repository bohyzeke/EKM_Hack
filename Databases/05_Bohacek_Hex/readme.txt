Description of the demo database 'Application':

This demo database shows the possibilities offered by the application of the Electronic-Key-Manager. The data of the respective employee are stored on the Electronic-Key; in addition, his picture can also be stored in the PC-database. Also stored is the access right at a specific level and the process where the employee is involved. For monitoring the Electronic-Key, the date of issue and the expiration date are stored on the Key. The CRC-field is used for data security on the Electronic-Key, for preventing data from being manipulated. The user 'ekm' is fully authorized for all rights of the 'administrators' group, which means all available rights. The user 'Raiser' owns all rights of the 'maintenance' group; this is only a selection of the rights available.
