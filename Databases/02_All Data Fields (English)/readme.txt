Description of the demo-database 'All data fields':

This demo database shows the possibilities of several users, who have access to different data. Each available data type is used once in this database to indicate the different fields of application. The users 'ekm' and 'admin' see all data. The user 'db' only sees the data from the PC-database, the user "key" only sees the data on the Electronic-Key. As all data elements are placed on a 'group-box' for each case, only the appropriate 'group-box' is made visible through the user right.


The users installed are:

User                    Password

admin                   admin
ekm                     ekm
